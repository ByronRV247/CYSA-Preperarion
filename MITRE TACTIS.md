1. Reconnaissance
Gathering intel (e.g., scanning, phishing research).

2. Resource Development
Acquiring infrastructure (e.g., domains, malware hosting).

3. Initial Access
Breaching the target (e.g., phishing, exploits).

4. Execution
Running malicious code (e.g., scripts, binaries).

5. Persistence
Maintaining foothold (e.g., backdoors, scheduled tasks).

6. Privilege Escalation
Gaining higher permissions (e.g., kernel exploits).

7. Defense Evasion
Avoiding detection (e.g., fileless malware, disabling logs).

8. Credential Access
Stealing passwords/tokens (e.g., Mimikatz, keylogging).

9. Discovery
Exploring the environment (e.g., network mapping).

10. Lateral Movement
Spreading across systems (e.g., RDP, Pass-the-Hash).

11. Collection
Gathering target data (e.g., screenshots, clipboard theft).

12. Command and Control (C2)
Remote control (e.g., DNS tunneling, reverse shells).

13. Exfiltration
Data theft (e.g., FTP transfers, cloud storage).

14. Impact
Disrupting operations (e.g., ransomware, data destruction).

Key Notes:
Order Matters: Tactics often (but not always) follow this sequence.

Enterprise Focus: Applies to networks, not just endpoints.
